# Data-Job-Market-Analysis-Project
This project analyses roughly 500,000 tech job postings from the 2024 DataNerd.com data job dataset to understand trends within the current data and tech job market. The analysis pipeline combines SQL-driven data extraction, Python and Excel for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and interactive Power BI dashboards to present insights clearly and visually.

## Project Backgorund / Motivation
I’m studying Computer Science and Statistics, and I wanted to explore what the future job market might look like for someone with my skill set. This dataset of data and tech job postings gave me a realistic way to investigate questions like:
- How do salaries compare between different roles and locations?
- How available are remove or hybrid positions?
- Which technical skills are most in demand?
- What's the split between junior, mid, and senior roles?

While working on this project, I was able to practise essential data analytics skills like:
- Building a repeatable SQL based workflow
- Cleaning and transforming messy data
- performing exploratory data analysis in Python & Excel
- Creating interactive visualisations with Power BI that communicate clearly communicate insights for a non-technical audience
