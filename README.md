# Data-Job-Market-End-To-End-Analysis-Project

This project analyses roughly 500,000 tech job postings from the 2024 DataNerd.com data job dataset to understand trends within the current data and tech job market. This analysis pipeline combines exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, deep analysis, and dashboard building.

## Project Backgorund / Motivation

I’m currently studying Computer Science and Statistics, and I wanted to move past theoretical learning and see what the market actually demands. This dataset of data and tech job postings gave me a realistic way to investigate questions like:

- How do salaries compare between different roles and locations?
- How available are remote or hybrid positions?
- Which technical skills are most in demand for each role?
- What's the split between junior, mid, and senior roles?

### This project demonstrates the following essential data analytics skills:

- Full technical process explained [here](PROCESS.md)
- **Data Cleaning:** Cleaning & transforming data with Power Query, Excel, and Python (Pandas).
- **SQL (MySQL):** Building a repeatable SQL based workflow.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Performing EDA with Python (Pandas).
- **Visualisations:** Creating interactive visualisations with Power BI that clearly communicates insights for a non-technical audience.


# Key Insights
Rather than doing a simple surface level summary, I analysed the data to find answers and insights to the four "Executive Questions" that I designed to help guide my own career path. The full analysis can viewed [here](ANALYSIS.md).
