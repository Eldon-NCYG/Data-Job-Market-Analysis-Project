# Deep Analysis into the Data
Rather than doing a simple surface level summary about the data (which can be shown through data visualisations alone), this deeper analysis to goes above and beyond uncover less obvious patterns, trends, and relationships. I analysed how specific job roles differ from each other, how geographic and technical competence factors affect salaries, and what technical skills are most in-demand and trending.





## Executive Questions:
I have organised my analysis into four different categories of questions. Each category has questions designed to yieled deeper, decision-relevant insights.


### Technical Skill Importance: What skills should I learn to stay ahead of the curve and have the best ROI?

#### **Foundational Skills:** What are the universal foundation skills that every data professional must have, regardless of title and seniority?


#### **Skills Trending in 2024:** Which emerging skills saw the highest growth in 2024? Does this pose a shift in the industry's standard tech stack for the future?


#### **Skill Category Value:** Which skill category categories currently have the highest average salaries, and does this remain consistent across different seniority levels?

#### **Skill Density & Compensation:** Does a broader toolkit (average unique skill for a job posting) actually lead to a higher pay?



### Job Market Trends: How did hiring volatility and seniority shifts throughout 2024 affect the 

### **Market Share & Saturation** Which roles dominate and are the most in-demand in the current data job market.

### **Were there hiring seasons during 2024?:** Which month in 2024 had the highest and lowest volume of new job postings?

### **Is the barrier of entry into the data tech field getting higher?:** Is the market favouring senior or junior roles? How did the number of senior and junior roles change throughout 2024?

### **Role Specific Volatility:** Which specific roles showed the most consistent hiring volume regardless of the season?

### **Role Complexity:** Are job postings getting more or less complex in 2024? Is the average number of skills per posting increasing over time?


### Geographical Influence: Where are the best job opportunities located?

### **Global Opportunity Density:** Which countries have the highest number of job postings relative to the number of unique companies hiring there?

### **Remote Job Distribution and pay:** Which countries have embraced remote work, and which countries are staying in the office? And do remote and onsite jobs differ in pay?

### **Degree Importance By Country:** Does where I live change how much employers care about a degree? And does a degree requirement lead to higher pay?








### Role Comparison Analysis: Which career path offers the highest salary return relative to its technical complexity?

#### **Technical ROI:** Which job role offers the highest salary return relative to its technical complexity? Considering technical skills and if a degree is required.


#### **Seniority Difference:** Which role has the steepest salary growth from Junior to Senior level?


#### **Degree Importance:** In roles where a degree is required, is the average salary higher, and does the market demand a higher number of specific technical skills to compensate?


#### **Skill Overlap between Data Analysts & Data Scientists:**  There seems to be a lot of nuance between these roles and they are often mistaken for each other. So what percentage of Data Analyst skills overlap with Data Scientist Skills?
