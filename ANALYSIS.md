# Deep Analysis into the Data
Rather than doing a simple surface level summary about the data (which can be shown through data visualisations alone), this deeper analysis to goes above and beyond uncover less obvious patterns, trends, and relationships. I analysed how specific job roles differ from each other, how geographic and technical competence factors affect salaries, and what technical skills are most in-demand and trending.





## Executive Questions:
I have organised my analysis into four different categories of questions. Each category has questions designed to yieled deeper, decision-relevant insights.


### Technical Skill Importance: What skills should I learn to stay ahead of the curve and have the best ROI?

#### **Foundational Skills:** What are the universal foundation skills that every data professional must have, regardless of title and seniority?


#### **Skills Trending in 2024:** Which emerging skills saw the highest growth in 2024? Does this pose a shift in the industry's standard tech stack for the future?


#### **Skill Category Value:** Which skill category categories currently have the highest average salaries, and does this remain consistent across different seniority levels?

#### **Skill Density & Compensation:** Does a broader toolkit actually lead to a higher pay?



### Job market Trends:
**Were there hiring seasons during 2024?:** Which month in 2024 had the highest and lowest volume of new job postings?

**Seniority Bias?:** Is the market favouring senior or junior roles? How did the number of senior and junior roles change throughout 2024?



### Market Trends & Timing:



### Geographical Influence: Where should I live to maximise my job options and pay?













### Job Titles: Role Comparisons

**Market Share & Saturation** 
Which roles dominate and are the most in-demand in the current data job market.

#### **Skill Overlap between Data Analysts & Data Scientists:** What percentage of Data Analysts skills overlap with Data Scientists skills? (I'm most interested in both of these roles)




### Job Location Impact:
**Remote Job Distribution by:** For each country, compare the number of remote and on-site jobs.

**Global Opportunity Density:** Which countries have the highest number of job postings relative to the number of unique companies hiring there?

**Degree Importance By Country:** Does the percentage of roles that require a degree vary significantly between different countries?



### Salary Analysis:


**Seniority Difference:** Does seniority affect the a role's average and median salary, and if so, how much?





**No-Degree Opportunity Cost:** For roles that don't require a degree, is there a significant difference in salary?
